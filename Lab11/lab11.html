<h1>Lab Exercise Eleven</h1>
<br>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p class="bodytext">
The purpose of this lab is to give some practice in using
dynamic data structures that use pointers to organize access.
It also introduces a few other ideas along the way, such as C++ <code>string</code>s
and the <code>stringstream</code>.
</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
This lab has quite a bit of code provided upfront. It is a good idea to
download, compile and play with it before attending your lab session.  Some of
the questions in the "More interesting operations" build on earlier pieces,
while others are quite separate. If you get stymied with some especially
elusive bug, consider reading the next couple of bullet points.  If they don't
obviously depend on your current part, you might be able to make progress and
return to your debugging with fresh insight. Remember both
<code>valgrind</code> (for memory leaks) and <code>gdb</code> (for segfaults)
can help in the hunt for problems.  </p> 

<p class="bodytext">
You may need to enable the C++11 options via the following flag: "g++ -std=c++11"
</p>

<h2>All creatures great and small</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
This week, we'll be storing data to describe nature
conservation areas, animal sanctuaries, wildlife refuges, and zoos.  
All these places (and their associated organizations) manage animals. Consequently,
we'll need an entity to represent an animal. Here's one that, though perhaps
not terribly detailed, is a starting point:
</p>

<a href="./lab11_files/animal_struct.svg"><img width="140" align="right" style="margin-left:8px;margin-top:50px;" src="./lab11_files/animal_struct.svg"></a>
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title">animal_t</span> {</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> desc; <span class="hljs-comment">// A description of the animal</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> age; <span class="hljs-comment">// Age of the animal</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span> is_nocturnal; <span class="hljs-comment">// True if the animal is nocturnal</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">animal_t</span> *prev; <span class="hljs-comment">// Pointer to previous animal in the list</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">animal_t</span> *next; <span class="hljs-comment">// Pointer to the next animal in the list</span>
};</code></pre>


<p class="bodytext">
The image on the right shows that it is useful to think of the structure in
terms of fields representing data specific to the animal and 
pointers serving to help organize the data. 
There are two additional things worth noting:
</p><ol>
<li style="margin-top:0px;">A description of the animal is stored in a field named <code>desc</code> and it is declared to be of type <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/"><code>string</code></a>. 
In order to use this type, you'll need to have <code>#include &lt;string&gt;</code>&nbsp; at the top of your source code. 
The <code>string</code>s are a modern C++ type that can be much more convenient
for textual data than C's <code>char[]</code>s because they can be resized
easily. They call <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> internally as
needed themselves. They also "know" their own length, so are significantly
safer.  Standard operations like assignment (<code>=</code>) and comparison
(<code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, etc.)
work as you might expect.
You're also still able to get the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/c_str/">underlying <code>char</code> data</a> if you want it. </li>
<li style="margin-top:9px;">Unlike the queue used last week, we're going to keep two pointers between elements of our list. It'll be slightly more bookkeeping, but will make some things quite a lot easier. The pizza queue was a singly-linked list and this is going to be a doubly-linked list (also sometimes called a double linked list).</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p class="bodytext">
It is also helpful to have a separate structure to describe facilities and their particular data. Again, the example
code is fairly parsimonious, but it gives the idea:
</p>

<a href="./lab11_files/facility_struct.svg"><img width="140" align="right" style="margin-left:8px;margin-top:15px;" src="./lab11_files/facility_struct.svg"></a>
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title">facility_t</span> {</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> name; <span class="hljs-comment">// Name of the facility</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> animal_count; <span class="hljs-comment">// A count of the elements in the linked list</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">animal_t</span> *head; <span class="hljs-comment">// Head of the doubly-linked list</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">animal_t</span> *tail; <span class="hljs-comment">// Tail of the doubly-linked list</span>
};</code></pre>

<p class="bodytext">
The spacing here is intended to make apparent the fact that there's a block for managing the list of animals
and that it is logically distinct from the other bits.
We'll have the animals associated with a particular facility via pointers. As the following
diagram shows, we'll keep track of both ends of the list:<br>
<a href="./lab11_files/list_with_3.svg"><img align="center" style="height:140px; margin-left:40px;margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="./lab11_files/list_with_3.svg"></a><br>
</p>

<h3>Getting up and running</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
Since it can be rather tedious to populate these lists, especially each time
you want to test some particular case, I've provided some code that will
initialize a doubly-linked list via data loaded from a text file.
Here's the code:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting code: <a href="http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs121/l11/zoo-starting-code.cpp">C++ Source</a></li>
<li>Data files: <a href="http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs121/l11/escobar.txt">Escobar's Menagerie</a>, <a href="http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs121/l11/central_park_zoo.txt">Central Park Zoo</a>, <a href="http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs121/l11/mimis.txt">Mimi's Marsupials</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bodytext">
Inspect the data files, then compile, run, and play with the code. 
You'll see that we have a convenient way to initialize multiple facilities.
For example, among others, it'll create this one:<br>
<a href="./lab11_files/list_with_1.svg"><img align="center" style="height:140px; margin-left:40px;margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="./lab11_files/list_with_1.svg"></a><br>
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Trace through the <code>create_facility</code> function. You'll see that
it uses the <code>string</code> type extensively. That is because this version of <code>getline</code> doesn't 
need to be given a maximum size: the <code>string</code> grows as needed.
The function also makes 
use of a new stream called <code>stringstream</code> which is 
convenient because it allows one to use the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator on
a string, just as if it were a file or <code>cin</code>.
(Did you spot that new header file in the preprocessor include at the top of the source?)
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Look at the <code>add_animal_to_facility_head</code> function to see the
doubly-linked list in action. You might find it useful to draw a little
diagram to see it working. For example, starting from an empty list
add three animals, one after the other.
</p>


<h3>Functionality to implement</h3>


<p class="bodytext">
Two functions use <code>new</code> to allocate memory. We know they ought to
have matching functions to free that memory (via <code>delete</code>), but
those weren't provided. Here are some steps that take you through fixing that issue.
</p>

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>Disconnecting a list element.</i>  <b>Step 1</b>: define a function to unlink a given animal from the list.
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">unlink_from_inventory</span><span class="hljs-params">(...)</span>
</span>{
  ... <span class="hljs-comment">// After this call, the animal_t should exist  </span>
  ... <span class="hljs-comment">// but no longer be part of the doubly-linked list</span>
}
</code></pre>
First determine what arguments it should take.

<div class="hinthidden">
<table><tbody><tr><td valign="center">
<table class="hintvisible"><tbody><tr><td><span style="font-size: 200%;"><b>?</b></span></td><td>HINT</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td>
<td style="padding-left: 14px;">
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="hinttext">
        You have to pass it a pointer to the <code>animal_t</code> that is
        to be unlinked. That much is obvious. But you also have to pass it a
        pointer to the <code>facility_t</code> because
        <code>animal_count</code> must be decremented and <code>head</code>, or
        <code>tail</code>, or both
        may need to be updated.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
Then implement it. You can test it on the following case:<br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 20pt;"></span>The US and China have had a spat. 
China demands its panda back.
Make a facility for the Beijing Zoo, then use <code>find_animal</code> to get a
pointer to the panda. Remove it from the Central Park Zoo, via
<code>unlink_from_inventory</code>, and then add it to Beijing (via
<code>add_animal_to_facility_head</code>).

</li>

<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>Freeing the memory associated with a list element.</i> 
<b>Step 2</b>: write a function to delete the animal.
Note that after calling this function, all pointers previously referring to that
item should now be considered invalid.
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">free_animal_mem</span><span class="hljs-params">(...)</span>
</span>{
  ... <span class="hljs-comment">// After this call, no more memory is associated with the given animal_t</span>
}
</code></pre>
</li>

<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>Freeing the memory associated with a whole list.</i>
<b>Step 3</b>: assuming that animals never appear in more than one
list, facilities should delete their associated lists before being
deleted themselves. Write a function that does this.
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">free_facility_mem</span><span class="hljs-params">(...)</span>
</span>{
  ... <span class="hljs-comment">// After this call, no more memory is associated with the given facility_t</span>
}
</code></pre>
Your implementation should call the previous two functions.
Call your function at the end of your program for each facility
that you've created.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="bodytext">
At this point, if your functions are working correctly, you should be able to
run <code>valgrind</code> and get a clean report showing no memory leaks.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
<u>An important reflection</u>:
The function <code>free_animal_mem</code> was very straightforward.
That's because the animals themselves didn't have anything (i.e., any fields/values)
dynamically allocated. It meant that <code>free_animal_mem</code> was
little more than a call to <code>delete</code>.
In contrast, <code>free_facility_mem</code> had real work to do. 
At first sight, it might've seemed silly to even have a function 
<code>free_animal_mem</code>. But consider that if we do create
some new dynamic variable(s) for the animals (maybe in <code>add_new_animal_to_inventory</code>)
we now have a place to relinquish that memory because
<code>free_facility_mem</code> calls 
<code>free_animal_mem</code>. A function that relinquishes resources on the
destruction of a data structure (resources like dynamic memory that was allocated, or closing files that were opened, etc.)
is called a <i>destructor</i>.

</p>

<h3>More interesting operations</h3>


<p class="bodytext">
There are several interesting operations worth implementing with
doubly-linked lists.
</p>



<ul>
<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>Adding items.</i> Given a reference to a <code>facility_t</code> and an
<code>animal_t</code> within that facility's inventory, write a function
that adds another <code>animal_t</code> into the inventory so that it 
appears directly <i>after</i> the given <code>animal_t</code>.
In the picture below, the arguments were the Central Park Zoo and the boomslang. The dromedary was 
added. <br>
    <a href="./lab11_files/list_with_4.svg"><img align="center" style="height:184px; margin-left:40px;margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="./lab11_files/list_with_4.svg"></a><br>
Now add a fourth argument <code>&nbsp;bool add_after=true&nbsp;</code> to the
argument list of your function. (The <code>= true</code> gives a default value
so you can still call it with only three parameters. Cool huh?) Improve your
function so that when the argument <code>add_after</code> is false, 
the new animal is added <i>before</i> the other one.
Be careful to ensure that you
maintain the validity of both the 
<code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>A selective query.</i>  
Write a function that, given a facility, prints out the list of the animals
you're likely to see being active on a nighttime visit.</li>

<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>Transferring lists.</i>  Escobar's Menagerie was raided by
the DEA's office and the animals seized. They are to be transferred to the
Central Park Zoo. Write a function that, given two 
<code>facility_t</code>s, results in the items in the second list being
concatenated with the items in the first list. Afterwards, the first list
should
have all the items and the second list should be empty.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>A linked list masquerading as an array.</i>  Write a
function, <code>get_nth</code>, to get the 
<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black;">n<sup>th</sup></span>
item in a linked list.
The language python has a cool feature where you can use negative numbers to count backward
from the end of a list. Co-opt that feature by including this behavior in your <code>get_nth</code> function as well.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>A linked list masquerading as a better array.</i>  
Write a function that allows you add an item into the list at location
<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black;">n</span>. 
You'll have to check that <span style="font-family:
STIXGeneral; color: black;">n</span> makes sense.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>Splitting an item.</i>  
Write a function that allows you to split 
an item in a list into two. 
Test it on the following case:<br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 20pt;"></span>A particular facility has 
some pretty meagre animal offerings. Among their catalog for public display they count
an earthworm. Zoo keeper Vince observes only one
earthworm in the worm enclosure on Monday afternoon.  But on Tuesday, a more 
diligent employee (Howard) spots two. <br>
    <a href="./lab11_files/item_split.svg"><img align="center" style="height:130px; margin-left:30px;margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="./lab11_files/item_split.svg"></a><br>
To ensure that after your function you do actually have two entirely distinct
earthworms, update the string for the second earthworm to 
read earthworm' (that's a prime). Then check that the first's name
has remained unchanged.
</li>

<li style="margin-top:14px;">
<i>Cloning.</i>  Unbeknownst to the zoo management, disgruntled employees have
been working late into the night 
conducting wicked experiments.  Their project
is to open a competing facility that'll charge lower entrance fees.
They want to ensure that they have all the same animals, so have been
engaged in cloning individual animals. Write a function that, given
a pointer to a <code>facility_t</code>, will produce another one with
copies of the same animals. <br>
    <a href="./lab11_files/list_clone.svg"><img align="center" style="height:260px; margin-left:130px;margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="./lab11_files/list_clone.svg"></a><br>
The crux here is that you need to clone the animals, not just the facility.
This is sometimes called a <i>deep copy</i> — in contradistinction to a <i>shallow copy</i>.<br>
(Another exercise, which is also useful practice if you're still wanting a bit more, is to write a function
that clones the facility but only keeping the daytime animals; those are the ones that attract the 
top dollar from visitors anyway.)
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Ordered insertion*</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
As mentioned above, the <code>string</code> type allows comparison of strings
via operations like <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code>. 
It orders strings
lexicographically, i.e., 
alphabetically with ties broken in favor of the shorter string.
This is the way words are arranged in a dictionary.
Using this feature, write the following function:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">add_animal_to_facility_sorted</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">facility_t</span> *facility, <span class="hljs-keyword">animal_t</span> *ani)</span>
</span>{
  ... <span class="hljs-comment">// place animals in position to maintain a sorted inventory</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p class="bodytext">
By replacing the last line of <code>add_new_animal_to_inventory</code>
so that it calls this function instead, you can test your code easily by rearranging the animals within
the input files.
</p>
