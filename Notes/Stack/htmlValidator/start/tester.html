<h1>This is a header</h1>


<p>
We write paragraphs like this. Some points are <b>important</b> and should
be <i>emphasized</i> in the text using the fancy markup features.
</p>

<h2>This is a sub-header</h2>

<p>
Other things involve more subtlety. Like a list:
</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a list item in an ordered list. </li>
<li>We can have multiple of them.</li>
<li>Just like this.</li>
<li>Sometimes we include some further details:
    <ol>
        <li>Roses are red;</li>
        <li>Violets are blue &mdash; though you'd think they'd be violet.</li>
        <li>Rub a dub dub</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Sometimes we don't.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final bit</h2>

<p>
That's all folks.
