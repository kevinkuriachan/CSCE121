- null terminated char array 
- take a string and find the end of a word 
- ask yourself: what is an easier version of the problem:
	- going through char array and making a new pointer for every new word 
split("...")
	start at linked list 
	for each word:
		add a block of data to my list 
		make a block for the word if already seen
	return head of linked list 


Cleanup part:
	cannot delete num the first time you see it. 
	- you could walk through linked list, if there is a duplicate of current element,
		set duplicate's pointer to NULL
	- walk through and delete every element
