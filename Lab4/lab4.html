<h1>Lab Exercise Four</h1>
<br>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p class="bodytext">
This lab will give you additional practice with arrays and a great deal with
strings. You'll see that this lab, like the prior one, asks you to think about
useful test cases to help ensure that your code is working correctly. Try
to cultivate this skill!
</p>

<h3>How far must I get?</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
This lab is assigned for the entire week.  Look over
the questions and make an attempt at some of the questions before arriving at
your lab session.  This way you can optimize your lab time and get help with
the questions that are most tricky for you.
You're expected to complete the questions that you're not able to finish in
the lab on your own. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Strings as <code>char</code> arrays</h2>
<p class="bodytext">
These exercises in this section build up incrementally, so it's best to make sure
you are quite confident with your answer to a question before moving onto the
next.  If you get stuck (or frustrated, or bored with strings) then you can skip to the questions 
on Shuffling or Pig Latin, below, and then return to this question anew.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
It will probably be helpful to reuse parts of your previous solutions. 
Think about this as a
way of planning your approach, organizing your code, and testing the validity
of your prior answers.  <i> Don't be deceived by the simplicity of the
operation
being asked for</i>—behind their seemingly trivial requirements lurk
many fiddly conditions. Producing code which works correctly for all of these
conditions is a challenge, demanding thoroughness and clear logical thinking.
If you run into difficulties, perhaps with
functions producing unpredictable or unexpected behavior, the likely source is
something which is failing to ensure that the resulting array of characters
ends with a <code>'\0'</code> character.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
<i>Important:</i> Even if you know of a string library that can perform many of these operations,
the point of these exercises is to write your own functions.
We're using string processing as a way to practice working with arrays. 
You should only use <code>char[]</code>'s for these questions, absolutely no
fancy C++ classes for strings, or regular expressions, or any other
chicanery not covered in the lectures.</p>

<h3>Appending a character</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
Write a function that takes a string and modifies it by appending a capital X to its end.
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">appendX_unsafe</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> str[])</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// modifies the input, appending an X to it.</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p class="bodytext">
To test your function you may find the following <code>main</code> function useful.
It uses <code>cin</code> in a different way—this new way is helpful
because it allows you to prompt the user for strings that include spaces.
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> mystr[<span class="hljs-number">100</span>];
    <span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"Please enter a string: "</span>;
    <span class="hljs-built_in">cin</span>.getline(mystr, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>);

    appendX_unsafe(mystr);
    
    <span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"mystr = '"</span> &gt;&gt; mystr &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"'\n"</span>;
    
    <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> s[<span class="hljs-number">100</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"lab three"</span>;
    appendX_unsafe(s);
    <span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"s = '"</span> &gt;&gt; s &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"'\n"</span>;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}
</code></pre>



<p class="bodytext">
The previous function was unsafe because if <code>str</code> was an array of
size <code>7</code> and contained the string "<code>danger</code>", then
the string "<code>dangerX</code>" would have overrun. Do you see why?
</p>

<div class="hinthidden">
<table><tbody><tr><td valign="center">
<table class="hintvisible"><tbody><tr><td><span style="font-size: 200%;"><b>?</b></span></td><td>HINT</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td>
<td style="padding-left: 14px;">
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="hinttext">
            Here "danger" = ['d', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'r', '\0'], but
            "dangerX" = ['d', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'r', 'X', '\0'], which requires
            the memory for 8 characters.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p class="bodytext">
Now, extend your previous function by also passing in the number of characters
in the array, and checking that you don't write beyond where you should.
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">appendX</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> str[], <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> len)</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// modifies the input, only appending an X if it would still be within bounds</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p class="bodytext">
Test your code by trying</p>
<pre class="tight"><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> t[<span class="hljs-number">7</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"danger"</span>;
 appendX(t,<span class="hljs-number">7</span>);	
</code></pre>

<p class="bodytext">
and comparing it with</p>
<pre class="tight"><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> t[<span class="hljs-number">8</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"danger"</span>;
appendX(t,<span class="hljs-number">8</span>);	
</code></pre>
<br>

<p class="bodytext">
It is usually worth your while to construct test inputs for your code during
the process of writing it. Try to get into the habit of doing this.
</p>



<h3>Concatenating two strings</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
The next step is to write a function that appends one string to the end of
another. If the combined length is longer than can be safely
stored, append as many characters as can be safely stored, but
don't forget to always ensure you include a terminating <code>'\0'</code>.
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">catstrings</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> first[], <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> fst_len, <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> second[])</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// concatenate second to the end of first, while not overrunning first</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p class="bodytext">
One smart way to test your code is to make an array which is actually longer
than <code>fst_len</code>. If you fill that array with some unusual character, say a <code>'~'</code>,
you can check whether any part beyond <code>first[fst_len-1]</code> has been
overwritten by ensuring that the remainder of the entries are still filled with 
<code>'~'</code>s.
To do so, you'll need to
write your own function to print out all elements of the array, since <code>cout</code> always stops at the first <code>'\0'</code>.
This can help give you confidence that your code is respecting the 
<code>fst_len</code> limit for operations that change (or write) memory, but
it won't ensure that you don't try to read memory that you shouldn't.
Careful reasoning is the best way to deal with the latter issue.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Writing the code for the previous question that is correct for all instances
requires extreme care.  Even though your program may seem to run without any
problems, that only provides limited evidence for correctness. Ask one of your
peers to try find an input that causes your code to act incorrectly. Then do
the same for them. If you can't find anyone to do it in person, post your
code to piazza.
</p>

<h3>String comparison</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
Write a function that compares two strings, returning true if and only
if they are identical.
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">string_eq</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> first[], <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> second[])</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// return true iff two strings are identical, character for character </span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p class="bodytext">
You may think that just using the line <code>first == second</code>
would do the job. <i>Try it!</i>
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
It'll compile. If your testing is only cursory, it might even trick you into
believing that it's working correctly. Here's an example: for some previously
defined variable
<code>str</code>, if you call <code>string_eq(str, str)</code> as a test,
you'll get <code>true</code>.  And <code>string_eq("hot", "dog")</code> will
return <code>false</code>, also just as you'd expect.
But, in fact, strings (and arrays in general) won't work correctly this way because
they are aggregate data types.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Once you get your <code>string_eq</code> working correctly, write 
a new function <code>string_eq_nocase</code> which compares
two strings but ignores
differences in the case of letters (so that <code>"bungle"</code> and
<code>"BUNgle"</code> are identical). 
</p>

<div class="hinthidden">
<table><tbody><tr><td valign="center">
<table class="hintvisible"><tbody><tr><td><span style="font-size: 200%;"><b>?</b></span></td><td>HINT</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td>
<td style="padding-left: 14px;">
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="hinttext">
<a href="http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs121/code/501_fourc.cpp" <="" a="">Here</a>
is code that includes a function <code>lower_to_upper</code> that returns
the uppercase twin of any lowercase letter.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>



<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">string_eq_nocase</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> first[], <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> second[])</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// a case insensitive check for string equality</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Stripping multiple spaces</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
Some typesetting conventions, especially those from the middle of the last
century (which were influenced by the fixed width characters of typewriters), 
involved sometimes putting two succeeding spaces after certain punctuation symbols. 
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Write a function that takes a string (as an array of characters) as input and
modifies it so that, wherever it has multiple consecutive spaces, these
become a single space. For example
<code>"Some<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>*crazy*<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣␣␣␣</span>s<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣␣</span>p<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣␣␣␣</span>a<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>c<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣␣␣</span>i<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣␣</span>n<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>g<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣␣</span>!!"</code> becomes 
<code>"Some<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>*crazy*<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>s<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>p<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>a<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>c<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>i<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>n<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>g<span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span>!!"</code>,
where here I've used <code><span style="color:#aaaaaa;">␣</span></code> to denote the space character <code>' '</code>.

</p>

<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">strip_dup_spaces</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> str[])</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// removes all consecutive spaces from str</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<div class="hinthidden">
<table><tbody><tr><td valign="center">
<table class="hintvisible"><tbody><tr><td><span style="font-size: 200%;"><b>?</b></span></td><td>HINT</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td>
<td style="padding-left: 14px;">
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="hinttext">
        Some good test cases might start with multiple spaces, have some words in the middle, but also end with multiple spaces.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>


<h3>Substring search</h3>


<p class="bodytext">
Write a function that looks for one string as a substring within another.
Here we consider <code>"engine"</code> as a substring of the following string (a pithy quotation
of Rick Cook):
</p><blockquote><code>"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to
build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to
produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning."</code>
</blockquote> 
For this question, we want the substring to appear in sequence and without requiring deletions so,
although <code>"engines"</code>  can be found within the quotation (via <code>"<u>engine</u><span style="color:#9e9e9e">er</span><u>s</u>"</code>, we see that it is a
subsequence), we don't consider it a substring.
<p></p>

<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">contains_sub_str</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> haystack[], <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> needle[])</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// return true iff needle appears within haystack</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<div class="hinthidden">
<table><tbody><tr><td valign="center">
<table class="hintvisible"><tbody><tr><td><span style="font-size: 200%;"><b>?</b></span></td><td>HINT</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td>
<td style="padding-left: 14px;">
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="hinttext">
Be careful about overrunning the end of either string. Also don't forget test cases that have a <code>needle</code> that is longer than the <code>haystack</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p class="bodytext">
Writing an efficient <code>contains_sub_str</code> function is
surprisingly difficult. Of course, we mainly care about correctness, so our
task is comparatively easy.
(If you're curious, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">this</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm">also this</a> Wikipedia page will
give you an entry into the world of string-matching algorithms; if this spurs your interest, talk with me about it.)
</p>

<h3>Substring deletion</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
Now combine the experience gained in writing <code>strip_dup_spaces</code>
and <code>contains_sub_str</code> functions,
to write a function that deletes the first occurrence of a substring,
if that substring appears in the input.
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">del_first_occur</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> input[], <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> cut[])</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// if cut appears in input, remove it and return true; </span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// otherwise leave input as is and return false</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Shuffling a Deck of Cards</h2>
<p class="bodytext">
Your previous effort in helping the local casino with their craps table was a
big success. It was so helpful that you're now their preferred consultant,
their go-to numerical ninja. This time it is to investigate some suspicious
payouts at the Texas Hold ’Em table.  The management suspect a crooked
croupier, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croupier_(film)">Clive</a>,
who is deft at manipulating cards. They suspect that, cunningly, he is dealing
crooked hands because he is able to control the deck. Your job is to get to the bottom of this
conundrum.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
You don your finest evening gown/black tie and head to the table to
play a few hands.  With a tiny camera concealed slyly about your person, you're
able to record Clive's shuffle technique close-up. After casually placing a few
bets, you swizzle a few expensive drinks (on the house, of course), then return to your
lab. </p>

<p class="bodytext">
As you pick over the details of the video with forensic care, you observe that
Clive's technique in shuffling the cards is definitely suspicious.
After pondering for a while, it hits you: his shuffles are just too perfect. He cuts
the standard deck of 52 cards precisely in half every time. Holding the 
top half in his right hand, bottom half in his left,
he then shuffles them so that they
interleave exactly: the cards come down singly, first one from the left hand, then one from the
right hand, one from the left, right, left, … flawlessly. He does it
every time, perfectly, with the repeatability of a machine. 
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Then you notice something else. The casino requires at least 5 shuffles per deal.
Clive exceeds this by a substantial margin: he shuffles 8 times per deal. It is always 8 times, not 7 on some occasions and 9 on others, but
8, always and exactly 8. Again and again, 8, religiously. 
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
To get to the bottom of the matter,
write some code to examine how a sequence of 8 perfect shuffles, as described above, permutes
the cards in the deck.
</p>


<h2>Pig Latin Printer</h2>
<p class="bodytext">
Write a function that is given a string (as a 
<code>'\0'</code> terminated char array) and prints it out to the console (via <code>cout</code>)
in Pig Latin form.  You should handle a whole string, translating it word by word. A single word is
converted to Pig Latin via following algorithm:
</p><ol>
<li>If the string begins with a vowel, simply append <i>"way"</i> to the end of the string. 
As an example, the Pig Latin for <i>"elephant"</i> is <i>"elephantway"</i>.</li>
<br>
<li>Otherwise, locate the first vowel, move all the characters before the vowel
to the end of the word, and add <i>"ay"</i>. For example, Pig Latin for
<i>"tradition"</i> is <i>"aditiontray"</i> as the two characters <i>"tr"</i>
appear before the first vowel.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p class="bodytext">
(For this question, use the five standard vowels: <i>a</i>,
<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>.)
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Note that you're not asked to produce a new string, only to output to <code>cout</code>. That makes
it easier because you don't have to make space for the <i>"way"</i> or <i>"ay"</i>.
You will likely find it is useful to write and test several separate functions
to achieve the final result.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Try to write all the code without needing to copy characters from the input
array into another array. In computing, the phrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy">zero-copy</a> is sometimes used
to refer to information processing operations which avoid having the CPU copy
data; it is typically used to improve efficiency. In this question, as we don't
know how long the string provided as input will be, we wish to avoid making
copies to ensure <i>safety</i>. (Later in the class, we'll be able to
allocate variables of sizes that are determined dynamically, so you'd be
able to make an array of the right size—but a solution without
needing to allocate new variables is still superior.)</p>

<h2>Numerical Expression Cost*</h2>
<h3>Converting to an arbitrary radix</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
A couple of exercises back we looked at how to pull off digits in an integer in
base 10 and also base 2. The latter was useful for various things, such as the
repeated squaring technique for computing exponents efficiently. In this
question you need to write a function to convert an integer input into
an arbitrary radix or base. Represent the output as an array.
This is the declaration for my function which does that:
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">convert_to_base</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">long</span> in, <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> out_digits[], <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> out_base)</span>
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// The inputs: in is a positive integer</span>

<p class="bodytext">
You should decide whether you'll put the least significant digits (the units)
at <code>out_digits[0]</code> or whether you'll put the most significant digit
there.  I found it computationally convenient to put the least significant
digits at lower indices of <code>out_digits</code>, but also wrote a function
that prints it in the more usual form of most significant digit first.

This section's title says "an arbitrary radix" but we're actually only
considering positive integer radices. And, at least for my code, extra work
was needed to handle base <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system">1</a>. Believe it or
not, you can express numbers in terms of bases that are fractions (such as ⅜),
real numbers (imagine base <span style="white-space: nowrap;
font-size:smaller"> √<span style="text-decoration:overline;">2</span>
</span>), and there's no reason why they can't be negative too! I don't know of
any applications for these strange representations, but if you discover one be
sure to tell me.  </p>

<h3>Computers that use ternary</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
In the past, there have been several serious proposals to build computers
which would use ternary, i.e., base 3, as the underlying representation for
data. Rather than <i>bits</i> (binary digits) such computers have memory
measured in <i>trits</i> (ternary digits). Nikolay P. Brusentsov and Sergei Sobolev,
of Moscow State University, developed a computer called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setun">Setun</a> that operated successfully
with the ternary representation. Between 1958–1965 about fifty such machines
were produced and operated. On this side of the Atlantic, the original proposal for the MIT
Whirlwind considered base 3 but never explored those ideas in their
real implementation, and some decades later researchers at SUNY Buffalo designed the <span style="font-size:smaller">TERNAC</span> which used base 3.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Binary has the advantage of being easy to implement reliably through electronics.
So why consider using ternary, then? The answer is that base 3 is more
efficient. But what exactly is the efficiency of a particular radix? The typical
definition takes the width
of a representation  multiplied by the radix.<br>
If <span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black;font-size:larger;">width</span> = number of columns of digits, and we have
<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black; font-size:larger;">radix</span> = number of symbols, then<br> 
<span style="padding-left:250px; font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black; font-size:larger;">cost<sub>radix</sub> = width × radix</span>.<br>
By this measure, base 3 is the most efficient of all integer bases. 
</p>

<h3>Ternary doesn't always win</h3>

<p class="bodytext">
Despite base 3 being more efficient than base 2 for an infinite number of
integers, there are some specific ones where binary wins out. For
example, to represent 65,535 in binary, you need 16 bits,
yielding a representational cost as <span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black;">cost<sub>2</sub>(65535) = 16 × 2 = 32</span>.
Whereas a ternary
representation requires 11 trits, 
and hence <span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black;">cost<sub>3</sub>(65535) = 11 × 3 = 33</span>.
So we see that 
<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; color: black;">cost<sub>3</sub>(65535)
 &gt; cost<sub>2</sub>(65535)</span>.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Use your <code>convert_to_base</code> function to count how many integers 
are more efficiently represented in binary than ternary. 
</p>

<div class="hinthidden">
<table><tbody><tr><td valign="center">
<table class="hintvisible"><tbody><tr><td><span style="font-size: 200%;"><b>?</b></span></td><td>HINT</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td>
<td style="padding-left: 14px;">
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="hinttext">
        There are exactly 8,487 values for 
<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral;">x</span> where
<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral;">cost<sub>3</sub>(x) &gt; cost<sub>2</sub>(x)</span>.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p class="bodytext">
It turns out that the question of the most efficient representation isn't
just a two horse race. There's another positive integer base that beats
binary and ternary for a small set of numbers.
Use your <code>convert_to_base</code> function to find this third base
which can beat out base 2 and base 3 in some particular cases.
